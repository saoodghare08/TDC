            Diet is a form of respect and discipline one offers to their body
            and soul. There is no specific food group that will assist you in
            reaching your fitness goal; rather it is a holistic approach that
            includes a protein-rich balanced diet, physical activity, and
            adequate sleep. It takes one to be focused, have patience and most
            importantly, be consistent to adapt to a balanced lifestyle. <br />

                So firstly I was very skeptical that will I be able to do it
                with all the busy work and all. But the overall journey for 3
                months was very good, the aim to get back to a balanced
                lifestyle was achieved I have lost good amount of weight learned
                a lot about my eating style and how to have a balance. Coming to
                the plans were very
                <span class="card__read-more">
                  good with enough were very good with enough options to make
                  them with everything within the kitchen nothing extraordinary.
                  I am overall quite satisfied with my journey 💫</span

                How should I start this ! So when I actually enquired you on the
                diet plan, I was very much doubtful coz u won't believe me I was
                trying to reduce my weight for like around one and half years !
                I never understood that dier played a huge part though I am a
                person who workout at gym !
                <span class="card__read-more">
                  I again thought ok let me try but I was very unsure of the
                  result. But then it was 15 days of diet and i saw the weight
                  scale and my energy improving, I could not believe that just
                  started to happen in 15 days itself, and then it was around
                  one and half months and I started receiving comments
                  compliments and so many surprising questions hey you look so
                  good what are you doing and it was not just one or two but
                  many of them. I can't express them in just these words And i
                  saw a huge change in the way I look especially my face it
                  started losing fat and it looked so sharp that my jawline was
                  visible and few of them asked if I had gone through any
                  surgery for this sharp jawline. I can go on say as I was so
                  happ happy that I feel this way. And Sabah thank you so much
                  for being there for me and making me look like a new me. I
                  feel now more confident and more energetic and I know how
                  exactly to maintain this and definitely I will be taking this
                  plan again to continue being fit. Thank you so much.</span

                This was my second plan with Sabah, the first one being last
                year. I really liked the overall plan and I liked how the plan
                came with the recipe section compared to last year. My
                Cholestrol levels were messed up before starting the diet plan,
                and Sabah asked me to strictly stick to the plan
                <span class="card__read-more">
                  for the first 45 days, and it was great to see that reflect in
                  my results. I also lost some fat in the process and felt great
                  about my body overall. Also she aptly kept a track of what I
                  was eating, giving me multiple options and things to improve
                  upon. So overall I’m grateful to her for the results that I’ve
                  achieved, and definitely would recommend her and come back to
                  her in future!</span

                I started consulting Sabah at beginning of 2022 for improving
                nutrition. i was skeptical initially due to an experience with a
                previous dietician. However after my first interaction with
                Sabah, she was able to instill confidence that she would give me
                a
                <span class="card__read-more">
                  sustainable diet and I would achieve my goals without
                  starving. Sabah has good knowledge and understanding of
                  nutritional requirements of each individual, based on their
                  lifestyle and goals. I like the fact that she is more focused
                  on reducing the body fat than just the overall weight, which I
                  find to be healthier and sustainable in the long term. She
                  keeps a track of my workout routine and then plans my diet
                  accordingly, which helps me maintain my energy levels through
                  out the day. I find her very approachable on day-to-day basis
                  for consulting on the planned diet. She is always there to
                  guide and take follow-ups of my daily diet, which helps me
                  remain on track. The diet plans are easy to follow as she
                  makes sure that it’s not very different than my existing food
                  preferences. My journey and experience towards having a
                  healthier lifestyle has been amazing till now, thanks to
                  Sabah.</span

                We went for check up for my husband. Doctor was astonished to
                see my hubby. She couldn't believe that his BP came down. She
                was amazed to see these changes in him without taking any
                tablets. She recommended tablets 3 months back. But we did not
                take and strictly followed your diet.

                  His BP became normal and he reduced 15 kgs. All the credit

                  recommended for my husband. She said please help other

                  to shed. He is back into shape and became more active through
                  your diet plan. He is able to fit into his clothes which he
                  was not able to wear previously. His colleagues are also
                  surprised to see such a big change in him within a short
                  period of time. These 3 months have changed the way we eat.

                My weight loss journey was gradual and started 14 months back
                and got arrested at a certain level. Coupled with physical
                exercise and Sabah’s diet, managed to shed 2 kgs in 42 days,
                which I can humbly submit, is considerable at my age. Prior to
                Sabah’s diet I was a proponent
                <span class="card__read-more">
                  of taking large gaps between meals which Sabah did not concur
                  with and instead prescribed meals with smaller portions at
                  regular intervals which kept the hunger pangs satiated and
                  energy levels maintained. Thank you, Sabah… still following

                I'm immensely grateful for Sabha ma'am's guidance during my
                six-month weight loss journey, which led to a remarkable
                transformation from 123.8 kg to 95.9 kg. Her personalized diet
                plan made losing 28 kgs achievable and enjoyable, without
                feeling deprived.

                  Her constant motivation kept me focused, and I feel healthier
                  and more confident now. I can't thank Sabha ma'am enough for
                  her expertise and dedication. She genuinely cared about my
                  progress, always providing positive reinforcement and
                  addressing my queries. Losing 28 kgs in six months, and
                  witnessing my weight drop from 123.8 kg to 95.9 kg, was
                  life-changing, and I highly recommend her services for a

                Ms Sabah Ghare is both an outstanding individual and dietitian.
                Her inimitable patience, understanding, and guidance allowed me
                to reduce my weight from 86.5 kgs to 80.3 kgs within a period of
                3 months without any excercises. If not impossible to reduce
                weight especially
                <span class="card__read-more">
                  as due to my knee issue i was unable to do exercises and
                  workouts. I overtook it as a challenge, and under your
                  complete guidance throughout, who held me and motivated me at
                  the same time to become as fit as I wanted to be without
                  feeing any hunger pangs. The best part of the diet program was
                  that the recipe also was included in the plan including the
                  multiple options of diet food to be taken. I had thought that
                  my weight problem would have no solution ever before I met
                  you. I remember you saying with that bright smile on your face
                  that my weight problem would be alright. You ensured that I
                  did not have to face much pace. I am indebted to you for this.
                  You are the nicest person I met, so humble, so much patience
                  to always listen to me every time. Replying me on WhatsApp
                  every time, no matter what time and how busy you are.
                  Understanding my habits, my family routine and along with that
                  helping me in my diet plan. Thank you for giving me the tools,
                  education, creative ideas and resources to help make healthy
                  life changes.” My prayers are always with you.</span
